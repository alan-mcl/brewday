This is a top-fermentation strain well suited for fermenting British ales, particularly dark and full bodied ales, mild brown ales and Scottish Heavy ales. Selected to not over attenuate, this strain will stop short of the low end gravities exhibited by other yeast strains. Dark fruity esters are pronounced when fermented at the appropriate temperature. Care should be taken to adjust hop bitterness to ensures it suits the ester character and complements the fuller bodied finish.",

These characteristics allow the malt and hop profile to really shine, and creates a crisp finished beer.\n\nWe recommend a brief diacetyl rest at ~ 60-65 F (2-3 days) at the end of primary fermentation. An extended lagering phase at 33-35 F will encourage the yeast to settle and create a clean profile.",

To use the blend for kettle souring a 5 gallon batch, prepare a 1 liter starter of approximately 1.040 specific gravity and pour contents of pouch into unhopped starter. Incubate 24-48 hours at room temperature to increase cell count. Prepare wort as normal and cool to 75-95F. Pitch Lactobacillus starter into unhopped wort and allow to sour to desired level. Maximum levels of sourness should develop within 48 hours. There is no need to hold the temperatures at the high end of the range for effective souring due to the efficient action of plantarum at lower temperatures. When desired sourness is achieved, re-boil wort to kill Lactobacillus.  Add hops at this time if desired.  This blend is extremely hop sensitive.  Souring may not occur in worts with 2 or more IBUs.  Cool wort and pitch yeast to complete fermentation.",

    "description": "Lactic Acid Bacteria are inhibited by hops, high gravity and low temperatures.  You can adjust sourness by increasing or decreasing these variables.  More than 7 IBU, gravity above 1050 or temps below 65 F will increase the time to sour or lead to reduced overall souring.\n\nWe recommend brewing with GB110 in one of three ways.  I)  \"Hot Start\":  Pitch GB110 to wort at 98 F with little or no hops for 48-72 hrs.  Wort may be soured before kettle boil or after.  If soured before kettle boil,  boil with hop additions as usual.  If soured after kettle boil cool wort and pitch yeast.  II)  \"Co-Pitch\":  Pitch GB110 into a primary with yeast of your choice at 68-72 F.  Wort that is less than 1050 and 7 IBU will typically be very sour in 2-3 weeks.    III)  \"Secondary\":  Pitch GB110 after primary fermentation for an aged sour.  Souring by this method typically requires several months.  Adding simple sugars or fruit etc. will enhance souring in the secondary.",
