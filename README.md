POC for beer brewing app that is process-centric instead of recipe-centric.

This project was born out of frustration with BeerSmith and other existing brewing apps. 
The recipe-centric UX approach and data models of every available haven't really changed since ProMash,
but ultimately beer recipes are less important and interesting than process.

BreDay attempts to put the focus on process design, rather than recipe design. 
It aims to support building process flows impossible with current software, for example splitting a batch multiple
ways before or after the boil and tracking the output of all fermentations.

It's coded in Swing because I know the tech well and can bash out a POC quickly.

*Current status:* Currently dormant. 

The POC Swing UI turned out well, although it trended back towards starting with recipe design because 
that's the simply the best place to start. The process-design bit showed tons of promise; I would use a full featured
app like this over BeerSmith in a heartbeat. However other priorities have come up, and the detailed UI work wasn't that exciting.
Maybe one day I will be inspired to build it out some more...
