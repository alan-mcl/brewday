Oak staves (the wooden strips that oak barrels are constructed of) are air dried for two to three years, then traditionally fire-toasted and cubed. Since three varieties are available, you are able to blend different levels of toast to achieve different effects. While the heavy-toast cubes are recommended for big reds that benefit from a heavy, caramelized oak flavor, they may also be used to supplement the medium-toast cubes for a more subtle flavoring. Many of our customers use a blend of French and American cubes, usually using the French cubes in a higher percentage.

    "name": "Apple Extract",
    "description": "These extracts should be added to your bottling bucket just prior to bottling. Traditionally, fruit flavors were added to wheat beers, witbiers, blonde ales, porter and stouts. Today, breweries are adding these flavors to just about any style of beer. \n\n Since the extract is added at bottling time, it is very easy to flavor only part of the batch. For example, if you made a Midwest Porter, you could bottle half of the batch without the extract, then add half the bottle of extract to the bottling bucket, stir, and bottle the rest. Use up to 4 oz. per 5 gallon batch.",
