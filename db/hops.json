Noble hop pedigree represented in alpha and beta acids being about equal.  Works well with a variety of beer styles including lightly hopped session beers, and all hop-forward beers of American and Belgian origins such as pale ales, IPAs and Saisons.  Possible similar hops: none.\n\nFormerly known as US4/78. This locally bred aroma type hop variety was selected specifically for South African conditions.

J17/63 is a day neutral high alpha variety, which requires moderate planting distances and an average of 9-10000 strings and 27-30000 bines per hectare.  Bines are vigorous and perform well on a standard framework. The medium sized cones with an average volume of 0.24g are semi tight, dense and pick very easily.  The cone to leaf ratio is 60:40.  Alpha development is normal.Because of the excellent alpha acids content and good yields, J17/63 gives a very high alpha acid production per hectare.\n\nCohumulone 26.5%, Storeability (Pellets) TBC, Isomerisation (Pellets) TBC, Total Oil ml/100g 1.3%, Humulene 21.4%, Caryophyllene 12.8%, Hum/Car Ratio 1.7, Farnesene 4.9, Myrcene 28.4%",
